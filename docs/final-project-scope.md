## FINAL PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT

#### *Project Name: Kierstin's Music Player*

#### Project Purpose

This project will increase my familiarity with building a well-structured, two-page website for music playback using HTML and CSS tags while showcasing everything I have learned over the course of 8 weeks. It also showcases icons with links to my professional social media. The repository will serve as a tangible, professional portfolio piece that demonstrates my ability to manage a new digital project from conception to completion, showcasing my skills in project management, documentation, and basic web design and development.

#### Description

I am building a new website while also delivering a comprehensive project package. This includes the planning documents that justify and define the project, the technical prototype itself, and a reflection on my process. The webpage prototype will provide me with an opportunity to share my favorite music, highlight artists, and include features such as:

* two-page layout
* HTML
* CSS
* music playback
* default controls for playback
* album art

#### Desired Results

The website prototype renders correctly and includes:
* A two-page layout that is clear and simple to follow
* Functional music playback
* Proofread content free of spelling and punctuation errors
* No coding errors or broken links
* A desktop, tablet, and mobile-friendly interface
The first page hosts the music player and the second page hosts my social media links.

#### Exclusions

Since this project focuses on building upon the foundation of an HTML and CSS webpage with the addition of audio, the webpage will initially be void of: 
* Comments, message, or chat functions
* A custom domain (website will be hosted from the free github platform)

#### Priorities

1. Error-free code
2. Functional playback and links
3. Clear layout and structured content

#### Acceptance Criteria

Instructor Greg Gamel will sign off on the project on 03OCT25 when it includes:

* a selected topic for Project 03
* a new professional GitHub repository containing all Project 03 assets with GitHub Pages enabled for hosting the website prototype
* a documentation folder (docs/) containing a project scope statement, project plan, and project retrospective
* a two-page website prototype (HTML \& CSS) that is live and functional on the web and hosted by GitHub Pages
* a comprehensive repository README.md file to introduce and explain my new website project
* navigation on and between each page without confusion
