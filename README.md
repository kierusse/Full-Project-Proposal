# Full-Project-Proposal
#### This project is the culmination of everything I have learned in my first computing applications course. It is a full project proposal including risk management calculation, a plan, scope statement, reflection on my process, and a website prototype. The website prototype is created by myself, Kierstin Russell, for the purpose of furthur developing my HTML and CSS skills, officially launched in October 2025. It will house my rotating favorite songs and continue to serve as an opportunity to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS as well as enhanced languages in the future. It has a two-page layout with the first page hosting the music player and the second page hosting links to my professional social media pages. I plan to experiment with features showcasing my music taste and look forward to developing my coding skills!
