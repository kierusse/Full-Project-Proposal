## FINAL PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT

#### *Project Name: Kierstin Russell's Music Player*

#### Project Purpose

This project will increase my familiarity with building a well-structured, two-page website for music playback using HTML and CSS tags. It also showcases icons with links to my professional social media. This final project showcases everything I have learned over the course of 8 weeks. It combines the mindset of a hybrid technical generalist from the 2019 "Range" by David Epstein with the practical framework of Kogon and Blakemore's 2024 "Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager". I am building a new website while also delivering a comprehensive project package. This includes the planning documents that justify and define the project, the technical prototype itself, and a reflection on my process. The repository will serve as a tangible, professional portfolio piece that demonstrates my ability to manage a new digital project from conception to completion, showcasing my skills in project management, documentation, and basic web design and development.

#### Description

The webpage prototype will provide me with an opportunity to share my favorite music, highlight artists, and include features such as:

* two-page layout
* HTML
* CSS
* music playback
* default controls for playback
* album art

#### Desired Results

The website prototype renders correctly and includes all desired features. The two-page layout is clear and simple to follow, and the music playback functions in a browser. The first page hosts the music player and the second page hosts my social media links.

#### Exclusions

Since this project focuses on building upon the foundation of an HTML and CSS webpage with the addition of audio, the webpage will initially be void of JavaScript features.

#### Priorities

1. Clean code
2. Functional playback
3. Clear Layout

#### Acceptance Criteria

Instructor Greg Gamel will sign off on the project on 03OCT25 when the project includes:

* a selected topic for Project 03
* a new professional GitHub repository containing all Project 03 assets with GitHub Pages enabled for hosting the website prototype
* a documentation folder (docs/) containing a project scope statement, project plan, and project retrospective
* a two-page website prototype (HTML \& CSS) that is live on the web and hosted by GitHub Pages
* a comprehensive repository README.md file to introduce and explain my new website project
